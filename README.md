# SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains a Python-based project for detecting SMS spam messages using machine learning techniques. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment as a web application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The key steps involved in the project are:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to remove noise and handle missing values.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.

3. **Text Preprocessing**: Converting text data into a suitable format for model training, including tokenization and vectorization.

4. **Model Building**: Training a machine learning model on the processed data. Various algorithms may be explored to find the best-performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Model Improvement**: Fine-tuning the model to enhance its accuracy and robustness, possibly through hyperparameter tuning or experimenting with different models.

7. **Deployment**: Deploying the final model as a web application to allow users to input SMS messages and receive predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detection.git
   cd sms-spam-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open and run the Jupyter notebook to train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sms-spam-detection.ipynb
   ```

4. **Deploy the Model**:
   Follow the instructions in the notebook or additional deployment scripts to deploy the model as a web application.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It is loaded from a CSV file (`spam.csv`) included in the repository.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building and deploying a machine learning model for SMS spam detection. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
